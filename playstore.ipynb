    "# Play Store Apps\n",
    "This project contains data on around 11,000 apps on the Google PlayStore. Interesting questions to consider include:\n",
    "- Does the length that the complaint is open depend on ethnicity/age/gender?\n",
    "- Are white-officer vs non-white complaintant cases more likely to go against the complainant? \n",
    "- Are allegations more severe for cases in which the officer and complaintant are not the same ethnicity?\n",
    "- Are the complaints of women more succesful than men (for the same allegations?)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of questions that can be asked from this data, so be creative! You are not limited to the sample questions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and EDA\n",
    "- Clean the data.\n",
    "    - Some columns may have non-sensical values in them. Do some exploration to find those values and reason how they should be dealt with.\n",
    "    - You may want to create bins for numerical columns for interesting aggregations\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Understand the data in ways relevant to your question using univariate and bivariate analysis of the data as well as aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment of Missingness\n",
    "- Assess the missingness per the requirements in `project03.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test / Permutation Test\n",
    "Find a hypothesis test or permutation test to perform. You can use the questions at the top of the notebook for inspiration."
