# 80_test_datasets

This is a project 3 dataset proposal done on Google Play Store App data used in a COGS course (I believe 118a, found the dataset through a friend). It was originally intended to predict Rating of an app.

The Project 3 Mockup can be found at [PlayStore_EDA.ipynb](./PlayStore_EDA.ipynb)

The blank version that could be handed to students could then be [playstore.ipynb](./playstore.ipynb), but I think this file needs to be updated a little bit more since 

Major concern is that I'm not sure if the resulting projects will have a good range of complexity since the dataset has a smaller number of columns (essentially 9 excluding dates and version numbers) when compared to that of outages and nypd datasets.
